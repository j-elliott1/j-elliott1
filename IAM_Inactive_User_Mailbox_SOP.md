We ran across an issue where we found upwards of 1000 disabled accounts in our Active Directory Environment. While  a good number of these were shared mailboxes we found that maybe we should revisit the amount of time a user account was allowed to remain dormant in our environment. What was even more troubling was the fact that we did not have any SOPs that existed for shared mailboxes. I proposed the following solution.

This standard establishes the procedures for regularly reviewing inactive user accounts and shared mailboxes to ensure business needs, proper ownership, and access control. Accounts or mailboxes without valid justification will be disabled, archived, or deprovisioned. The process supports XXXX’s commitment to least privilege, data security, and regulatory compliance.

Bringing security, transparency, and excellence to our Active Directory environment.




 
Identity and Access Management (IAM) Policy Statement (if something already exists for users we can remove all related context and focus solely on Shared/resource mailboxes)
Inactive User and Shared Mailbox Accounts
Organization Name (Will be referred to XXXX) is committed to maintaining a secure, compliant, and efficient computing environment by managing user and shared mailbox accounts in accordance with institutional policies and regulatory requirements.
This policy establishes clear standards for the identification, management, and remediation of inactive user accounts and shared mailboxes within XXXX IT environment.
________________________________________
Policy Statement:
All user accounts and shared mailboxes must be actively managed to uphold the principles of least privilege, data protection, and operational efficiency.
1.	Inactive User Accounts
o	User accounts with no login activity for a period of 10 consecutive months will be classified as inactive/disabled and deprovisioned after 1 year. (Currently we review at 10 months of inactivity and remove at 1 year, should we review this process? Could be excessive and allow for un-necessary security risks)
o	Inactive accounts will be subject to a formal review process to determine continued business need.
o	Accounts without valid business justification will be disabled and, after an additional retention period, permanently deprovisioned. 
2.	Shared Mailbox Accounts
o	Shared mailboxes must have a documented business purpose, designated owner, and authorized access list. (Currently there is no process for reviewing shared mailboxes, I propose the actions below)
o	All shared mailboxes will be reviewed semi-annually to confirm ongoing need, ownership, and access appropriateness.
o	Shared mailboxes no longer meeting business or compliance requirements will be archived or decommissioned.
3.	Roles and Responsibilities
o	IAM Team: Oversees account review process and maintains documentation. Performs technical reviews, audits, and remediation actions.
o	Departmental Owners: Validate account or mailbox purpose and provide business justification.
o	Compliance Office: Ensures adherence to internal policies and external regulations.
4.	Documentation and Compliance
o	All account reviews, decisions, and actions must be logged in a centralized system of record.
o	Documentation will be retained per XXXX’s data retention policy and made available for audit or compliance review.
5.	Enforcement
o	Failure to comply with this policy may result in access restrictions, account suspension, or other corrective actions.
