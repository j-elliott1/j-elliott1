# 🧩 TechWrite + Automate: A Modern Documentation Hub
The goal is to create a living library of project documentation, technical writing samples, and automation prototypes — designed to streamline IT operations, identity governance, and beyond.
# 📚 What You'll Find Here
This is part showcase, part sandbox. You’ll find:
- 📝 Project charters, SOPs, and user-friendly IT documentation
- ⚙️ Templates for asset management, IAM governance, and compliance
- 🤖 Early-stage automation with Power Automate (coming soon)
- ⚙️ Powershell Scripts and Splunk Queries
- 💬 AI prompt libraries for policy writing and workflow drafting
All content here is adapted, anonymized, or built from scratch to reflect real-world standards with a creative twist.
# 🔧 Tools Used (or Coming Soon)
- Markdown + Diagrams.net
- Power Automate
- ChatGPT and Julius for Prompt Engineering
- VS Code + Extensions
- PowerShell
- Splunk
- IT Asset & IAM frameworks
- Lucid
- O365
- M365 Admin, Entra ID, Exchange Admin, Purview
- Adobe Acrobat
- Who knows at this point what we will get in to!
# 🌱 Why Am I Doing This
Because good documentation isn’t a luxury, it’s the backbone of secure, efficient, and ethical tech.  
And maybe, just maybe, we can learn something and have a little fun along the way.
