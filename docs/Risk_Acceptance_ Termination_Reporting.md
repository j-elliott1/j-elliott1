Introduction
This document outlines the risk acceptance for the organization's noncompliance with P-14 account removal policies. The noncompliance pertains to the delayed or incomplete removal of user accounts following the end of employment or service.

Scope
This risk acceptance applies to all departments and personnel responsible for managing user accounts, including IT, HR and Compliance teams.

Risk Description
Noncompliance with account removal policies can result in various risks including, but not limited to:

1. Security Risks: Former employees or service users retaining access can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential data breaches, and misuse of resources.
2. Regulatory Risks: Failure to comply with industry standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) could result in legal penalties and fines.
3. Reputational Risks: Incidents arising from noncompliance can damage the organizationâ€™s reputation, impacting customer trust and business relationships.

Risk Assessment
1. Likelihood: Medium. While there are processes in place for account removal, human error and system inefficiencies can lead to delays or oversights.
2. Impact: High. Unauthorized access to sensitive data could have severe financial, legal, and reputational consequences.

Justification for Acceptance
Despite the risks outlined, the following factors have led to the decision to accept the risk of noncompliance:

1. Resource Constraints: Current resource limitations (e.g., staffing, budget) hinder the ability to promptly and thoroughly manage account removals.
2. Mitigating Controls: Planned compensatory controls (e.g., access reviews, manager correspondences) will reduce the likelihood and impact of unauthorized access.
3. High Historical Incidence: There have been a high number of incidents related to noncompliance with account removal, overview of the new planned procedure suggests the overall risk will be reduced.
4. Planned Improvements: There are ongoing initiatives aimed at improving account management processes, including automation and enhanced oversight mechanisms.

Risk Mitigation Plan
To manage and mitigate the risks associated with noncompliance, the following actions will be undertaken:

1. Automation: Invest in automated account management tools to reduce human error and improve efficiency.
2. Training: Enhance training programs for staff responsible for account management to ensure understanding and adherence to policies.
3. Periodic Reviews: Conduct regular audits of user accounts to identify and address any discrepancies.
4. Policy Updates: Update account removal policies to reflect current best practices and ensure they are communicated across the organization.

Monitoring and Review
The risk acceptance and associated mitigation efforts will be reviewed quarterly by the Risk Management Committee (TBD) to ensure effectiveness and adjusts as necessary.
