Single Sign-On (SSO) & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Security Policy

1. Policy Overview
This policy establishes the requirements and procedures for implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to protect organizational resources and ensure secure access to systems and applications.
Policy Effective Date: [Insert Date]
Policy Owner: Information Security Team
Review Cycle: Annual

2. Scope and Applicability
•	All employees, contractors, and third-party users accessing organizational systems
•	All applications and systems that handle sensitive or confidential data
•	Remote access to corporate networks and cloud-based services
•	Administrative and privileged accounts

3. Authentication Flow Requirements
3.1 Primary Authentication Process
Step 1: SSO Sign-In
•	Users must authenticate through approved SSO providers
•	Failed SSO attempts result in immediate access denial
•	All SSO events must be logged for audit purposes
Step 2: Multi-Factor Authentication
•	MFA is required for all users accessing corporate resources
•	Maximum of 3 MFA attempts allowed per session
•	Failed MFA attempts after 3 tries result in account lockout
•	Approved MFA methods: SMS, authenticator apps, hardware tokens, biometrics
Step 3: Risk-Based Telemetry Assessment
•	System evaluates contextual data including device, location, time, and behavior
•	Risk factors include: new device, unusual location, off-hours access, suspicious behavior patterns
•	High-risk scenarios trigger additional security measures or access denial

4. Session Management Requirements
User Type	Session Duration	Re-authentication Required
Standard Users	8 hours	Daily or after inactivity > 30 minutes
Privileged Users	4 hours	Every 4 hours or after inactivity > 15 minutes
Administrative Users	2 hours	Every 2 hours or after inactivity > 10 minutes
External/Contractor	4 hours	Every session or after inactivity > 20 minutes
Continuous Monitoring: Sessions must be continuously monitored for risk indicators. New risk detection during an active session triggers step-up authentication.

5. Risk Assessment Criteria
5.1 High-Risk Indicators
•	Login from unrecognized device or location
•	Access attempts outside normal business hours
•	Multiple failed authentication attempts
•	Unusual data access patterns
•	Concurrent sessions from different locations
•	Access from high-risk IP addresses or countries
5.2 Risk Response Actions
Medium Risk: Require additional authentication factor or security questions
High Risk: Deny access, notify security team, and require manual verification

6. Logging and Monitoring Requirements
Required Log Events:
•	All authentication attempts (successful and failed)
•	MFA challenges and responses
•	Risk assessment results and actions taken
•	Session creation, expiration, and termination
•	Access denials and security alerts
•	Administrative actions and configuration changes
Log Retention: Authentication logs must be retained for a minimum of 12 months and made available for security investigations and compliance audits.

7. Incident Response Procedures
7.1 Failed Authentication Events
•	3 consecutive failed MFA attempts: Account lockout for 15 minutes
•	5 failed attempts within 1 hour: Account lockout for 1 hour
•	10 failed attempts within 24 hours: Account disabled, manual review required
7.2 High-Risk Access Attempts
•	Immediate access denial
•	Automatic notification to security team
•	User notification via secure channel
•	Investigation within 4 hours
•	Documentation of findings and actions taken

8. Compliance and Audit Requirements
Regular Reviews:
•	Monthly review of authentication logs and security events
•	Quarterly assessment of risk thresholds and criteria
•	Annual policy review and update
•	Semi-annual penetration testing of authentication systems
Compliance Standards: This policy supports compliance with SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and applicable data protection regulations.

9. Roles and Responsibilities
Role - Responsibilities
Information Security Team -	Policy development, risk assessment configuration, incident response
IT Operations -	System implementation, monitoring, maintenance, user support
Users -	Compliance with authentication requirements, reporting security incidents
Management -	Policy approval, resource allocation, compliance oversight

10. Exceptions and Waivers
Exception Process: Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented, approved by the Information Security Officer, and reviewed quarterly. Emergency access procedures must be pre-approved and regularly tested.
